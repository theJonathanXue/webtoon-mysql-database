# MySQL vs PostgreSQL
I referenced several resources including these videos from IBM techonology [comparing the two technologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btjBNKP49Rk) and also explaining [MySQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO-yT7Ugnls)

I decided to go with MySQL as it is excellent for web applications, its ease of use, speed and scalability. I also wanted to learn another relational database besides PostgreSQL which I have used before.

# Database schema
| Field      | Type         | Description       |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| author_id  | INT          | Unique author ID  |
| author_name | VARCHAR(255) | Name of the author |
